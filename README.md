# Advanced Functional EDA:
 - Advanced functional EDA aims to be able to process data in a scalable, that is, functional way, and to gain insights about the data quickly. the process of quickly analyzing data with general functions


#### Steps of the profect:
      1. Checking the Dataset
          - Getting an outline of the internal and external features of the data set,
          how many observations, how many variables, missing values, etc.
      2. Analysis of Categorical Variables
      3. Analysis of Numerical Variables
      4. Analysis of Target Variables
      5. Analysis of Correlation
